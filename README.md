Design a program that will accept three input files:
          - pam250matrix.csv (a file containing the PAM250 scoring matrix
          - sequenceA.txt (amino acid input sequence A.)
          - sequenceB.txt (amino acid input sequence B.)
          Must compute the similarity graph and the dissimilarity score to write them
          in the OUTPUT.TXT file with the sequenceA and sequenceB.
